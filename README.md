The grade 12 computer science course introduced computer science fundamentals such as inheritance, recursion, abstractions, and API use through the development of data structures like linked lists, binary trees, hash tables, sorting algorithms and so on. This repository is a collection of some of my work throughout the semester as well as my own projects made out of curiosity.
